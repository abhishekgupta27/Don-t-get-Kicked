 Predict if a car purchased at an Auction is a lemon (bad buy). We develop predictive models that can predict beforehand whether a given vehicle in an auction is good buy or not so that the buyers can avoid the bad ones. The target variable is “isBadBuy”, expressed by a probability of being a lemon.
